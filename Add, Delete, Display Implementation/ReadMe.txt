Objective:
                  The purpose was to create a student management system using file handling. The system will give the user three functionalities of 
. Adding a student record
. Deleting a student record
. Displaying all the records in the file.

Method:
The student data was to be stored in a specific JSON like format in the file without using any spaces between a record of single student. By getting the inputs from user the attributes of student were stored on the file. Then by entering the registration no the user can delete that student from the file. This was done by first getting the line number in which the student record of that particular student was stored in the file and then by deleting that line. For that two functions were used one was called within the other. Finally the user can see all the records of the students stored in the file. Seperate functions were created for each function and then they were called in the main menue. The user input was restricted for entering the valid input for selecting an functionality.
